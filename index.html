    <h1>chrisrhoden's osfolio</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! chrisrhoden is using <a href="http://github.com">github</a>
      to manage his open-source and publicly maintained software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, github does not currently have a good way to mark
      projects with different levels of completeness. Rather than develop
      in a cave, chrisrhoden has opted to use this page to clearly mark
      which projects should be considered well-developed and which are
      rather pie-in-the-sky, silly ideas that he has had and created
      repositories to chip away at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following projects are <em>in early planning</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/metabot'>metabot</a></li>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/web-services.rb'>web-services.rb</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following projects are <em>good enough</em> that chrisrhoden
      has run them for <em>personal use</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/cdplus'>cdplus</a></li>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/wablog'>wablog</a></li>
      <li><a href='http://chrisrhoden.github.com/pea'>pea</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following are still under <em>heavy, active development</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://chrisrhoden.github.com/pea'>pea</a></li>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/wablog'>wablog</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of these projects include a README file (shown by default at the
      bottom of a github project's main page) which explains the purpose of
      a given project, as well as installation and basic use when appropriate.
    </p>
    <p class='dialog info'>
      <em>All</em> of chrisrhoden's projects on github are free to redistribute
      and modify. Some projects include code written by others, and this will
      be noted in the NOTICE file usually included with a project. You should
      totally fork a project if you think it's cool.
    </p>
    <p class='dialog warning'>
      <em>None</em> of chrisrhoden's code is offered with any warranty of any
      kind, and no guarantee is made to it's stability and suitability for a
      production environment. chrisrhoden still thinks it's all pretty neat,
      though.
